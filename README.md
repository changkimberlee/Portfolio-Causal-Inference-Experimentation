# Data Science Portfolio: Causal Inference & Experimentation

## **Overview**
Through these portfolios, I aim to showcase my approach to applying my experience in behavioral policy research and causal inference design to the tech industry, including user growth, ads, marketplace, pricing and policy impact. Beyond technical coding and modeling skills, I hope to show my considerations in forming research questions, reaearch design, indicators selection, model selection and result presentation under different scenarios. 

This portfolio focuses on understanding causal relationships, designing and analyzing experiments, and measuring impact. It is tailored for roles requiring statistical rigor and expertise in causal inference techniques.
